/// Represents an image view in SwiftUI that manages its content using Kingfisher.
///
/// This view asynchronously loads the content. You can set a ``Source`` to load for the ``KFImage`` through
/// its ``KFImage/init(source:)`` or ``KFImage/init(_:)`` initializers or other relevant methods in ``KF`` Builder type.
///  Kingfisher will first look for the required image in the cache. If it is not found, it will load it via the
///  ``Source`` and provide the result for display, following sending the result to cache and for the future use.
///
/// When using a `URL` valve as the ``Source``, it is similar to SwiftUI's `AsyncImage` but with additional support
/// for caching.
///
/// Here is a basic example of using ``KFImage``:
///
/// ```swift
/// var body: some View {
///   KFImage(URL(string: "https://example.com/image.png")!)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Usually, you can also use the value by calling additional modifiers defined on it, to configure the view:
///
/// ```swift
/// var body: some View {
///     KFImage.url(url)
///       .placeholder(placeholderImage)
///       .setProcessor(processor)
///       .loadDiskFileSynchronously()
///       .cacheMemoryOnly()
///       .onSuccess { result in  }
/// }
/// ```
/// Here only very few are listed as demonstration. To check other available modifiers, see ``KFOptionSetter`` and its
/// extension methods.
///
/// - Important: `KFImage` loads disk cached images synchronously by default (`.loadDiskFileSynchronously()` is enabled).
/// This prevents image flickering during SwiftUI view updates but may impact performance when loading large images from disk.
/// You can disable this behavior by calling `.loadDiskFileSynchronously(false)` if you prefer better loading performance
/// over visual consistency.
